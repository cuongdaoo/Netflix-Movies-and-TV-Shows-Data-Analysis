# **1. Overview**  
Netflix is one of the world's leading streaming platforms, offering a vast library of movies and TV shows across various genres and countries. With increasing competition in the streaming industry, understanding content trends, audience preferences, and production strategies is crucial for business growth and user engagement.  

This project aims to analyze Netflix's dataset to uncover insights about:  
- Content distribution (movies vs. TV shows)  
- Release trends over the years  
- Popular genres and ratings  
- Leading countries in content production  
- Directors and actors with the most contributions  

By leveraging data analysis techniques, we can identify patterns that help in decision-making for content creation, marketing strategies, and audience targeting.  

# **2. Objectives**  
The primary objectives of this analysis are:  
- **Explore the composition** of Netflix's catalog (movies vs. TV shows).  
- **Analyze growth trends** in content releases over time.  
- **Identify popular genres** and ratings to understand viewer preferences.  
- **Determine top-producing countries** to see where Netflix focuses its content creation.  
- **Examine key contributors** (directors, actors) who shape Netflix's library.  
- **Compare durations** of movies and TV show seasons to detect industry standards.  

This analysis will help stakeholders, including content creators, marketers, and business strategists, make data-driven decisions to enhance Netflix's offerings.

# **Potential Analysis Questions:**  

## Data Type Conversion for date_added Column
**Question** - How to convert the data type of date_added column from string to DATE?

**Explanation**:
1. First, we add a new column with DATE data type
2. Then we attempt to convert/cast the existing string data to DATE format
3. Optional steps include:
   - Dropping the old column if no longer needed
   - Renaming the new column to match the original column name
4. The TRY_CAST function is used for safe conversion that returns NULL instead of error if conversion fails

**SQL Code**:
```sql
-- Add new column with DATE type
ALTER TABLE netflix_titles
ADD NewDate DATE;

-- Update new column with converted data
UPDATE netflix_titles
SET NewDate = TRY_CAST(date_added AS DATE);

-- Optional: Drop old column
ALTER TABLE netflix_titles
DROP COLUMN date_added;

-- Optional: Rename new column
EXEC sp_rename 'netflix_titles.NewDate', 'date_added', 'COLUMN';

-- Verify results
SELECT * FROM netflix_titles;
```

## Question 1
**Question** - Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

**Explanation**:
Two approaches are shown:
1. Using conditional SUM to count movies and TV shows in a single row
2. Using GROUP BY to get counts in separate rows
Both methods filter the dataset by type and provide counts for each category

**SQL Code**:
```sql
-- Method 1: Conditional sum
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Movie' THEN 1 END) AS movie_count, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'TV Show' THEN 1 END) AS tvshow_count 
FROM netflix_titles;

-- Method 2: Group by
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS type_count
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY type;
```

## Question 2
**Question** - Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

**Explanation**:
1. First CTE calculates count for each type-rating combination
2. Second CTE ranks ratings within each type by count
3. Final query filters to only show top-ranked (most common) ratings for each type

**SQL Code**:
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix_titles
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        *, 
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS ranking 
    FROM cte
)
SELECT * FROM cte2
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

## Question 3  
**Question** - List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)  

**Explanation**:  
This query filters the dataset to show only movies released in the specified year (2020 in this example).  
- Uses a simple WHERE clause to filter by both `type` and `release_year`  
- The `release_year` field is stored as a string, so we compare it with a string value  

**SQL Code**:  
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE release_year = '2020';
```

    SELECT * 
    FROM netflix_titles
    CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(duration, ' ')
    WHERE type = 'Movie' AND value != 'min'
